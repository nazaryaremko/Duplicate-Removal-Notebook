This is a duplicate removal algorithm that I designed and wrote during my summer internship at Select recruiting company. The goal of this algorithm was given a google sheet of applicants, input it in the algorithm and return the list of candidates that are likely to be duplicates. I decided to develop a decision tree that optimizes the code by filtering out candidates that are certianly not duplicates by putting concrete questions in the beginning (regarding first name, last name, birthdate, etc) and more ambigious questions (regarding job title, town, etc) later in the decision tree. This allowed to avoid multiple unneccessary comparisons. Additionally, I used a hashmap to optimize lookup time of Russian-to-Ukrainian and vise versa translations. Furthermore, i also implemented various way of dealing with edge cases (names provided in different languages, missing or incorrect birthdays, etc). The algorithm returns the same google sheet but with an additional column in which for every row there is a list of potential duplicates with an indication of how likely they are to be duplicates (somewhat, highly likely).
